This project implements a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memory system using SystemVerilog. A FIFO is a fundamental component in digital systems and VLSI design, widely used for buffering, synchronization, and data transfer between different subsystems that may operate at different speeds.

The design is parameterized, meaning the data width and depth of the FIFO can be customized without changing the RTL code. This flexibility makes the module reusable in different applications ranging from small embedded systems to high-performance processors.
